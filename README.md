# FL-Defender: Combating Targeted Attacks in Federated Learning.
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of the paper: FL-Defender: Combating Targeted Attacks in Federated Learning.

## Paper 

[FL-Defender: Combating Targeted Attacks in Federated Learning]()

## Content
The repository contains one jupyter notebook for each benchmark which can be used to re-produce the experiments reported in the paper for that benchmark. The notebooks contain clear instructions on how to run the experiments. 

## Data sets
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) will be automatically downloaded.
However, [IMDB](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) requires a manual download using this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X86CyTJW77a1CCkAFPvN6pqceN63q2Tx/view?usp=sharing). 
After downloading [IMDB](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), please save it as imdb.csv in the data folder inside the folder IMDB.
